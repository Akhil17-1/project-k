#### Objective 2: Central Server
- [x] **Develop the Central Server**
  - Created a Flask server to receive logs from the agent.
  - Stored logs in MongoDB.
  - Added endpoints to fetch logs and log status from MongoDB.
  - Implemented CORS support to allow frontend access.

#### Objective 3: Frontend Development
- [x] **Setup Frontend with React and Visual Studio Code**
  - Created a React frontend using create-react-app.

- [x] **Home Screen Development**
  - Designed a Netflix-style home screen with options to navigate to different log types.
  - Displayed log success/error ratios.
  - Applied dynamic themes based on the log success rate.
  - Displayed top CVEs in a dynamic pattern.

- [x] **Log Type Screens**
  - Developed components to display logs based on selected log types.
  - Displayed logs systematically in a list format.
  - Integrated a chart to visually represent log counts.

#### Objective 4: Security and Additional Features
- [ ] **Implement Built-in Antivirus and Strong Vault for Password Security**
  - Pending: Integrate antivirus solutions.
  - Pending: Implement a secure vault for password management.

- [ ] **XDR, EDR Approach**

#### Objective 5: Final Integration and Testing
- [ ] **Local Testing**
  - Ensure all components work seamlessly together locally.
  - Conduct thorough testing to verify data collection, storage, and display functionalities.
